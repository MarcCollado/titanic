    "There was an interesting insight from the last graphic: the number of survivors in the age cohorts (35 to 50) and (50 to 65) was really similar to the number of people travelling in 1st and 2nd class for those respective cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "That led to the possibility that among those age cohorts, the ones that got out first were the passengers travelling in 1st and 2nd class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph above proves exactly that: **among age cohorts (35 to 50) and (50 to 65), almost all survivors came from 1st and 2nd class, and really few people from that age range (only 6 out of 209), survived from the 3rd class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the large bulk of survivors comes from the 18 to 50 cohorts, travelling in 1st and 2nd class. Therefore we can assume (as we've already seen in \"Survivors, by Gender and Pclass\") that 1st and 2nd class passengers had a better shot of survival compared to the folks at 3rd class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, despite not showing in the plot above, from the 8 passengers abroad over 65 years old, only one could make it: a first class passenger. Being the cohort over 65 among the ones with lower chances of survival."

    "After studying the dataset in depth, we can safely conclude there were several factors that contributed to the survival of the tragedy. Therefore some circumstances seemed to play a huge role and put you in a better position when it came to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, there were 891 passengers abroad, from those:\n",
    "- Did not survive: 549 (61.62%)\n",
    "- Survived: 342 (38.38%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 342 who survived:\n",
    "- 68.13% were women\n",
    "- 31.87% were men\n",
    "\n",
    "Which not only tells us that women had a higher chance of survival, but even more, if we put these numbers in a more global perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 314 women abroad (35.24% out of the total passengers)\n",
    "- Survived: 233 (74.21%)\n",
    "- Did not survive: 81 (25.79%)\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 577 men abroad (64.75% out of the total passengers)\n",
    "- Survived: 109 (18.89%)\n",
    "- Did not survive: 468 (81.11%)\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is not just that more women survived in absolute numbers, but percentage wise, the difference is huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "But things get even more interesting when we start digging into the travelling preferences. Here's the breakdown of chances of survival for men and women segmented by the class they were travelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women\n",
    "- 1st 96.80%\n",
    "- 2nd 92.10%\n",
    "- 3rd 50.00%\n",
    "Men\n",
    "- 1st 36.88%\n",
    "- 2nd 15.74%\n",
    "- 3rd 13.54%\n",
    "\n",
    "If being a woman was important, being a rich woman, almost granted you way out of the tragedy. Therefore gender played a huge role when it came to the survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we broke the dataset by age, it revealed two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the majority of passengers belonged to the 18 - 35 cohort\n",
    "- Second, that it was more likely to see passengers above 35 occupy 1st and 2nd class seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, what derives from the first bullet is that despite the largest cohort of people (18 - 35) were travelling mostly in 3rd class, they were among the ones who got the most survivors in absolute numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But overall, despite the disparity of age ranges, the survival rate across those cohorts remained the same except for the kids (higher) and the eldest (lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the breakdown by age and Pclass, revealed that among age cohorts (35 - 50) and (50 - 65), almost all survivors came from 1st and 2nd class, and really few people from that age range (only 6 out of 209), survived from the 3rd class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the factors that help surviving the tragedy were: first of all being a women, then if possible, travel in 1st or 2nd class, and finally, age between 35 and 50 years old."

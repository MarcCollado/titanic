# Exploring The Titanic üö¢
Data Analysis Project ‚Äî Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project belongs to Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. Below you'll find the rest of the Nanodegree projects and I also wrote a [short post](https://www.collado.io/blog/2018/udacity-dand) in my blog about the course experience.

## About
Was there a factor or combination of factors that contributed to the survival of the Titanic' tragedy?

This data exploration will investigate the [Titanic data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) ‚Äî containing information about its passengers ‚Äî and will give an answer to this question, uncovering amazing insights along the way.


## Tech Stack
The project was built with:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* Python 2.7
* [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Seaborn library](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) ‚Äî for the data visualization


## File Structure
The repository is structured as it follows:

* `titanic.html`: an .html rendered file with the results of the Notebook
* `titanic.ipynb`: the Jupyter Notebook where all the code is deployed
* `/data`: folder containing all the data files
